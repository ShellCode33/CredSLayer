Installation
============

The recommended way is to pull it from PyPI repository :

.. parsed-literal::
    $ [sudo] pip install credslayer

You can also install it from source :

.. parsed-literal::
    $ git clone https://github.com/ShellCode33/CredSLayer
    $ cd CredSLayer/
    $ [sudo] python setup.py install

.. note::
    If you want to try brand new features not released yet, from source you can switch to the develop branch using ``git checkout develop`` before installing.
